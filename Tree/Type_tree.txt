What is tree?
A tree is a data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is a hierarchical structure where each node has a value and zero or more child nodes. The topmost node is called the root node, and the nodes without any children are called leaf nodes. Trees are commonly used to represent hierarchical relationships in various domains, such as file systems, organizational structures, and decision trees in computer science. 

Type of Tree?
There are several types of trees in computer science, each with its own specific characteristics and uses. Here are some common types of trees:

Binary Tree: A binary tree is a tree in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This is the most commonly used type of tree in computer science.
B-Tree: A B-tree is a balanced tree data structure used for efficient storage and retrieval of data. It is commonly used in databases and file systems to store large amounts of data in a way that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.
AVL Tree: An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures the height of the tree remains balanced after each insertion or deletion. This is achieved by rotating nodes to maintain the balance property.
Red-Black Tree: A red-black tree is another self-balancing binary search tree that ensures the height of the tree remains balanced. It uses a combination of rotations and color labels on nodes to maintain the balance property.
Heap: A heap is a special type of tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. There are two types of heaps: the binary heap and the binomial heap. Heaps are commonly used for priority queues and sorting algorithms.
