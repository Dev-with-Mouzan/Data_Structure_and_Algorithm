BUBBLE SORT – DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS

1: Definition
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
This process continues until the list is sorted.

2: How It Works

Compare the first and second elements

Swap if the first is greater than the second

Move to the next pair

After each full pass, the largest unsorted element is placed at the end

Repeat for n-1 passes


3: Algorithm (Step-by-Step)

Input: Array of size n

For i from 0 to n-1:
For j from 0 to n-i-1:
If arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]

4:Time Complexity

Best Case: O(n) (when array is already sorted with optimization)
Average Case: O(n²)
Worst Case: O(n²)

5: Space Complexity

O(1) – In-place sorting algorithm


6: Stability

Bubble Sort is Stable (it preserves the relative order of equal elements).
